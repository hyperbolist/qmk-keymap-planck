# A Simple Corne-based Layout for Planck (rev6)

Based primarily on the [Corne](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd)'s [default layout](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/default/keymap.c), with some GUI functions lifted from [Noah Frederick](https://github.com/noahfrederick/qmk-keymaps).
